install docker
==============

Step 1: Update Software Repositories
It’s a good idea to update the local database of software to make sure you’ve got access to the latest revisions.

Open a terminal window and type:

sudo apt-get update
Allow the operation to complete.



Step 2: Uninstall Old Versions of Docker
Next, it’s recommended to uninstall any old Docker software before proceeding.

Use the command:
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io



Step 3: Install Docker
To install Docker on Ubuntu, in the terminal window enter the command:
sudo apt install docker.io


Step 4: Start and Automate Docker
The Docker service needs to be setup to run at startup. To do so, type in each command followed by enter:

sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker



Install KubeCtl
===============

For example, to download version v1.17.0 on Linux, type:
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.17.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl

Make the kubectl binary executable.
chmod +x ./kubectl

Move the binary in to your PATH.
sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl

Test to ensure the version you installed is up-to-date:
kubectl version --client


Connect Docker properly to Jenkins
===================================
sudo gpasswd -a jenkins docker

Edit the following file : vi /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service

And edit this rule to expose the API : ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker daemon -H unix:// -H tcp://localhost:2375

Now it’s time to reload and restart your Docker daemon:

systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart docker

Then I restarted jenkins and I was able to perform docker commands as jenkins user in my jenkins jobs

sudo service jenkins restart
